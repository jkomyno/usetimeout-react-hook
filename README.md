> React.js custom hook that sets a leak-safe timeout and returns a function to cancel it before the timeout expires.

## Install

```sh
npm install usetimeout-react-hook
```

## 🔑 Key features

* 🥇 inspired by [this awesome blog post](https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks) by [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon)
* ⚠️ optional manual cancelability of timeout
* ✨ uses [useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) dependencies array as a policy to dictate the hook updates, by default no dependency is specified
* 💪 written in TypeScript
* ✔️ 100% test coverage

## 🤔 Yet another setTimeout hook, why?

If you search something among the lines of [react-use-timeout](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=react-use-timeout) a number of results
appear. Why was this package necessary?

Most of the other timeout hook packages I've glanced at had the following shortcomings:

* stuck with setTimeout, with no generic timer support
* no custom re-render policy
* no tests in place

Sometimes user needs the ability to use a custom timer, since `setTimeout` may not always be the best choice, especially in
React Native applications. In fact, the primary reason I built this custom hook was to expose a customizable and reusable
timeout manager for an other package of mine, [react-native-user-inactivity](https://github.com/jkomyno/react-native-user-inactivity).
A number of users had pointed out that on **React Native** there were the following issues with `setTimeout`:

* it would cause a crash on Android after many minutes of timeout
* it would simply stop working when the application is in background

Hopefully this package will be useful to others as well.

## ❔ How to use

This package exposes two hooks, [useTimeoutDefault](src/useTimeoutDefault.ts) and [useTimeout](src/useTimeout.ts).
Actually, the first one is just a wrapper for the second, and uses the standard `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` as
timeout handler methods.
Since useTimeoutDefault is what many users probably need the most, it's the default exported package.
Each of this hook return a single function, which can be optionally used to manually cancel the timeout before it expires.
The type of this function, `CancelTimer`, is: `() => void`.

The signature of `useTimeoutDefault` is the following:

```typescript
import useTimeoutDefault from 'usetimeout'; // notice that it's a default import

/**
 * useTimeoutDefault is a React.js custom hook that sets a leak-safe timeout and returns
 * a function to cancel it before the timeout expires.
 * It uses the default timeout handlers, i.e. window.setTimeout and window.clearTimeout.
 * It's composed of two other native hooks, useRef and useEffect.
 * If a new callback is given to the hook before the previous timeout expires,
 * only the new callback will be executed at the moment the timeout expires.
 * When the hook receives a new callback, the timeout isn't reset.
 * 
 * @param callback the function to be executed after the timeout expires
 * @param timeout the number of milliseconds after which the callback should be triggered
 * @param deps useEffect dependencies that should cause the timeout to be reset
 * @return function to cancel the timer before the timeout expires
 */
type UseTimeoutDefault = (callback: () => void, timeout: number, deps?: unknown[]) => CancelTimer;
```

Since `usetimeout` supports a generic timer, it requires an implementation of the TimeoutHandler interface, which is defined as:

```typescript
interface TimeoutHandler<T> {
  /**
   * Timeout function that accepts two parameters:
   * a function and the timeout after which that function is fired.
   * If not provided, the default `setTimeout` implementation will be
   * the standard `window.setTimeout`.
   */
  setTimeout: (fn: () => void, timeout: number) => T;

  /**
   * Function that should be used to clear the effects of `setTimeout` after
   * the component where it is rendered is unmounted.
   * If not provided, the default `clearTimeout` implementation will be
   * the standard `window.clearTimeout`.
   */
  clearTimeout: (timeout: T | undefined) => void;
}
```

The signature of `useTimeout` is the following:

```typescript
import { useTimeout } from 'usetimeout'; // notice that it's a named import

/**
 * useTimeout is a React.js custom hook that sets a leak-safe timeout and returns
 * a function to cancel it before the timeout expires.
 * It's composed of two other native hooks, useRef and useEffect.
 * It requires a custom way of setting a timeout and clearing it, expressed as an implementation
 * of the generic TimeoutHandler<T> interface.
 * The timer is restarted every time an item in `deps` changes.
 * If a new callback is given to the hook before the previous timeout expires,
 * only the new callback will be executed at the moment the timeout expires.
 * When the hook receives a new callback, the timeout isn't reset.
 * 
 * @param callback the function to be executed after the timeout expires
 * @param timeout the number of milliseconds after which the callback should be triggered
 * @param timeHandler TimeoutHandler instance that's used to set and clear the timeout
 * @param deps useEffect dependencies that should cause the timeout to be reset
 * @return function to cancel the timer before the timeout expires
 */
type UseTimeout = <T>(callback: () => void, timeout: number, timeHandler: TimeoutHandler<T>, deps?: unknown[]) => CancelTimer;
```

## ✔️ Run tests

Tests are run using [**jest**](https://jestjs.io), at the end of the test a coverage table should appear.

```sh
npm run test
```

## 🚀 Build package

This package is built using **TypeScript**, so the source needs to be converted in JavaScript before being usable by the users.
**usetimeout** uses [**Rollup**](https://rollupjs.org) as build system, and the JavaScript module formats it's been configured to support are:

* CommonJS: module format used by Node (using `require` function).
* ESM: modern module format (using `import` syntax).
* UMD: Universal Module Definition, to be able to import it directly in the browser (not as popular these days).

```sh
npm run build
```
